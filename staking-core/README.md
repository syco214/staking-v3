# NFT STAKING

### Installation

#### Install Rust

`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

`source $HOME/.cargo/env`

`rustup component add rustfmt`

#### Install Solana

`sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.9.1/install)"`

#### Install Yarn

`npm install -g yarn`

#### Install Anchor

For now, we can use Cargo to install the CLI.

`cargo install --git https://github.com/project-serum/anchor --tag v0.19.0 anchor-cli --locked`

On Linux systems you may need to install additional dependencies if cargo install fails. On Ubuntu,

`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config build-essential libudev-dev`

Now verify the CLI is installed properly.

`anchor --version`

### LP token ID

Go to line 11 in  `staking-core/programs/nft-staking/src/lib.rs`.

And replace `LP_TOKEN_MINT_PUBKEY` to yours.

And if you want more amount for lp token, you can change `LP_DEPOSIT_REQUIREMENT` amount. You can calculate reall amount by using this formula. `amount * lp token's decimals powers of 10`

### Build Project

First, need to go to project directory on command window. And run below commands.

#### Build

`anchor build`

#### Copy Program ID

`cp program-id.json target/deploy/nft_staking-keypair.json`

##### NOTE: If you want to change program id of yours, you can use below command.

`solana-keygen new --outfile program-id.json --force`

`cp program-id.json target/deploy/nft_staking-keypair.json`

`solana address -k program-id.json`

Copy output result of this command and paste it to line 9 in `staking-core/programs/nft-staking/src/lib.rs`.

`anchor build`

### Deployment

#### DEVNET

Open `Anchor.toml` file and change `cluster` of `[provider]` to `devnet` and save it. And check wallet path of `[provider] wallet`.

Your wallet have to contain some SOL on devnet. If you have not any SOL on devnet, you can request some SOL on devnet by running 

`solana airdrop 2 SOL your_wallet_address`

`anchor deploy`

#### MAINNET

Open `Anchor.toml` file and change `cluster` of `[provider]` to `mainnet` and save it. And check wallet path of `[provider] wallet`.

Your wallet have to contain some SOL on mainnet.

`anchor deploy`

### Initialize Pool

##### NOTE: Before initialize, you has to have `LP` token and `REWARD` token mint addresses. Also, update line 31, 32 in `js/init.js`.

`mkdir json`

`solana-keygen new --outfile json/pool.json`

#### DEVNET

`yarn run dev-init-pool`

#### MAINNET

`yarn run init-pool`

### Set Pool Reward Per Token
